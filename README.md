# PropellerCharacterization
This project combines Goldsteins Vortex Theory with a vortex panel methods code allowing you to define your airfoil and see how it will perform as a propeller.

At the moment only NACA 4 series foils are included. However this can be expanded in the future. No math libraries were used in this project as it was in part an exercise not only in fluid dynamics theory but also in mathematical approx methods and programming

Java was chosen since it had an easy UI library, however it does leave additional capabilities desired and could look cleaner.
